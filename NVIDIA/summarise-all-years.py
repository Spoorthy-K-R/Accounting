    You are a financial analyst. Given the following financial statement tables for a company, perform a comprehensive analysis as follows:

    Financial Trends Analysis:
    - Summarize overall trends in revenue, profit, margins, debt, cash flow, and capital structure. Think of common size analysis and key financial ratios from a Financial Statement Analysis (FSA) course.
    - Identify any significant changes, anomalies, or turning points.
    - Spot potential red flags or opportunities (e.g., declining margins, rising leverage, growth acceleration).

    Insights and Explanations:
    - Explain the key drivers behind major changes
    - Interpret ratios or other computed metrics and provide context.
    - Assess risks and opportunities for investors.

    Valuation Advice:
    - Give a qualitative valuation perspective: Is the company undervalued, overvalued, or fairly valued based on its trends and financial performance? Should an investor buy, sell, or hold the companyâ€™s stock?
    - Provide supporting rationale (growth, profitability, risks, industry context).
    - Optionally, attempt a rough DCF, multiples-based, or scenario valuation and discuss any limitations.

    Here are the financial statements:

    Balance Sheet:
    {balance_text}

    Cash Flow Statement:
    {cash_text}

    Income Statement:
    {income_text}

    Please structure your response in three sections:
    1. Financial Trends Analysis
    2. Insights and Explanations
    3. Valuation Advice
