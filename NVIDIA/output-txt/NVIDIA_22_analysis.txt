| Diluted EPS                | $3.85         | $1.73         | $1.13         |
| **Margins (from % table)** |               |               |               |
| Gross Profit Margin        | 64.9%         | 62.3%         | N/A           |
| Operating Margin           | 37.3%         | 27.2%         | N/A           |
| Net Profit Margin          | 36.2%         | 26.0%         | N/A           |

**Step 2: Trend Analysis**

*   **Revenue:**  Significant growth in revenue over the three years.  Revenue increased by approximately 62% from 2021 to 2022 and approximately 53% from 2020 to 2021. This indicates strong top-line growth.
*   **Cost of Revenue:** Cost of revenue is also increasing, but at a slower pace than revenue, leading to improved gross profit.
*   **Operating Expenses:** Operating expenses are increasing, but also at a slower pace than revenue.
*   **Profitability:**  All profit metrics (Gross Profit, Income from Operations, Net Income) show substantial growth.  The growth rate in net income is particularly impressive.
*   **Margins:** Gross profit margin, operating margin, and net profit margin all improved from 2021 to 2022. This suggests increasing efficiency and profitability.
*   **Interest Income/Expense:** Interest income decreased significantly, while interest expense increased.
*   **EPS:**  Earnings per share (Basic and Diluted) have more than doubled from 2021 to 2022, reflecting the strong net income growth.

**Step 3: Risks and Opportunities**

*   **Opportunity:** The company is experiencing rapid growth and improving profitability. This makes it an attractive investment opportunity. The increasing margins suggest the company is gaining economies of scale or improving its pricing power.
*   **Risk:**  The rapid growth might not be sustainable. It's important to understand the drivers of this growth and whether they are likely to continue. The increase in interest expense and decrease in interest income could be a concern if it continues.
*   **Missing Data:** The absence of balance sheet and cash flow statement data limits the analysis.  We can't assess the company's financial health (liquidity, solvency) or how it's funding its growth.

**Step 4: Factors Explaining Operating Margin Fluctuation**

The operating margin increased significantly from 27.2% in 2021 to 37.3% in 2022. Several factors could explain this:

*   **Economies of Scale:** As revenue increased, the company may have benefited from economies of scale, meaning that fixed operating costs were spread over a larger revenue base, reducing the per-unit cost.
*   **Improved Efficiency:** The company may have become more efficient in its operations, reducing operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.
*   **Pricing Power:** The company may have been able to increase its prices without a significant decrease in demand, leading to higher margins.
*   **Mix Shift:** The company may have shifted its sales mix towards higher-margin products or services.
*   **One-Time Events:** There could have been one-time events that boosted operating income in 2022, such as a large contract win or a reduction in a specific expense.

**Step 5: Qualitative Valuation Assessment**

Based on the recent performance, the company appears to be a **growth company** with improving profitability. The strong revenue growth, increasing margins, and significant EPS growth are all positive indicators.

However, a more comprehensive valuation would require:

*   **Balance Sheet Analysis:** To assess the company's financial health, including its debt levels, liquidity, and asset efficiency.
*   **Cash Flow Analysis:** To understand how the company is generating and using cash.
*   **Industry Analysis:** To compare the company's performance to its peers and assess the overall industry outlook.
*   **Qualitative Factors:** To consider the company's management team, competitive advantages, and regulatory environment.

**Summary of Trends:**

*   **Strong Revenue Growth:** Significant increase in revenue year over year.
*   **Improving Profitability:**  Gross profit, operating income, and net income all show substantial growth.
*   **Margin Expansion:** Gross profit margin, operating margin, and net profit margin all improved.
*   **EPS Growth:**  Earnings per share have more than doubled.
*   **Interest Income/Expense:** Interest income decreased, while interest expense increased.

**Potential Risk:**

*   Sustainability of rapid growth.
*   Increase in interest expense and decrease in interest income.

**Potential Opportunity:**

*   Continued growth and margin expansion.

**Missing Information:**

*   Balance sheet data.
*   Cash flow statement data.

Without the balance sheet and cash flow statement, a complete valuation is impossible. However, based on the available data, the company shows strong growth and improving profitability, making it potentially attractive to investors. Further investigation is needed to assess the sustainability of these trends and the company's overall financial health.
