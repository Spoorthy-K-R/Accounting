    *   **Operating Margin:** Operating margin increased from 26.1% in 2020 to 27.2% in 2021. Operating margin in 2019 was higher at 32.5%.
    *   **Net Profit Margin:** Net profit margin increased from 25.6% in 2020 to 26.0% in 2021. Net profit margin in 2019 was 35.3%.
*   **Debt:** The provided data does not include balance sheet information, so we cannot assess trends in debt or capital structure. However, we can see interest expense, which decreased from $(58) in 2019 to $(52) in 2020 and further to $(184) in 2021.
*   **Cash Flow:** The provided data does not include a full cash flow statement.
*   **Capital Structure:** The provided data does not include balance sheet information, so we cannot assess trends in capital structure.
*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Basic EPS increased from $4.59 in 2020 to $7.02 in 2021. Basic EPS in 2019 was $6.81. Diluted EPS increased from $4.52 in 2020 to $6.90 in 2021. Diluted EPS in 2019 was $6.63.

**Significant Changes:**

*   The most significant change is the substantial increase in revenue in 2021.
*   SG&A expenses increased significantly in 2021.
*   Interest expense decreased significantly in 2021.

**2. Potential Risks and Opportunities:**

*   **Opportunity:** The strong revenue growth in 2021 is a significant opportunity. If the company can sustain this growth, it could lead to further increases in profitability and shareholder value.
*   **Risk:** The increase in SG&A expenses could be a concern. It's important to understand the drivers of this increase. If it's due to necessary investments in sales and marketing to support growth, it might be acceptable. However, if it's due to inefficiencies or uncontrolled spending, it could negatively impact profitability.
*   **Risk:** The decrease in operating margin from 2019 to 2020 and then a slight increase in 2021 could be a concern. It's important to understand the drivers of this decrease.

**3. Factors Explaining Operating Margin Fluctuation:**

The operating margin is calculated as (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100. Several factors could explain its fluctuation:

*   **Changes in Cost of Revenue:** While gross margin remained relatively stable, slight variations in the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue could impact the operating margin.
*   **Changes in Operating Expenses:** The increase in R&D and SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2021 compared to 2020 could have put downward pressure on the operating margin.
*   **Economies of Scale:** As revenue increases, a company may achieve economies of scale, leading to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and an increase in operating margin.
*   **Strategic Investments:** The company may have made strategic investments in R&D or SG&A to drive future growth, which could temporarily lower the operating margin.

**4. Qualitative Valuation Assessment:**

Based on the recent performance, here's a qualitative valuation assessment:

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   **Strong Revenue Growth:** The significant revenue growth in 2021 is a positive sign, indicating strong demand for the company's products or services.
    *   **Stable Gross Margin:** The stable gross margin suggests that the company has good control over its cost of goods sold.
    *   **Increased Net Income:** The increase in net income indicates improved profitability.
    *   **Increased EPS:** The increase in EPS indicates improved profitability on a per-share basis.
*   **Neutral Factors:**
    *   **Operating Margin:** The operating margin is good, but the decrease from 2019 to 2020 and then a slight increase in 2021 is a concern.
*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   **Increased SG&A Expenses:** The increase in SG&A expenses needs to be carefully monitored to ensure it's justified and doesn't negatively impact profitability.
    *   **Lack of Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Data:** The absence of balance sheet and cash flow data makes it difficult to assess the company's financial health and sustainability.

**Overall Assessment:**

The company appears to be performing well, with strong revenue growth and improved profitability. However, the increase in SG&A expenses and the fluctuation in operating margin are areas that need to be carefully monitored. Without balance sheet and cash flow data, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive valuation assessment. Investors should conduct further due diligence to understand the drivers of these trends and assess the company's long-term prospects.
